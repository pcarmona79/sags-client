Secure Administrator of Game Servers - SAGS Client
==================================================

SAGS (Secure Administrator of Game Servers) is a client-server
application to administer game servers on GNU/Linux using a SSL
connection.

The main idea is to provide a open source solution to GameHost by Xoanan
Industries but it must work on GNU/Linux. It must provide a robust
interface to manage the game server remotely.

The major features of the client are:

 - The client provides a direct interface to the game's console.

 - You can change the console's font and the program remembers the
   value.

 - The login dialog stores five entries of servers.

 - You can save the console's messages to a file.

 - It is portable to Windows platform.

The client have the GUI writed with wxWidgets and uses OpenSSL for
network communication. Also it can be compiled with Dev-C++ to
obtain the Windows version.
