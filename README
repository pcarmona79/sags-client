Secure Administrator of Game Servers - SAGS Client
==================================================

SAGS (Secure Administrator of Game Servers) is a client-server
application to administer game servers on GNU/Linux using a SSL
connection.

The main idea is to provide a open source solution to GameHost by Xoanan
Industries but it must work on GNU/Linux. It must provide a robust
interface to manage the game server remotely.

The major features of the client are:

 - The client provides a direct interface to the console of authorized
   game servers.

 - You can change the console's font and the program remembers the
   value.

 - The login dialog stores five entries of servers.

 - You can save the console's messages to a file.

 - It is portable to Windows platform (with XP themes support).

 - IRC-based chat support.

 - Chat window manages normal messages and /me, /notice and /topic
   commands. Also shows when users joins and leaves the channel.

The client have the GUI writed with wxWidgets and uses OpenSSL for
network communication. Also it can be compiled with Dev-C++ to
obtain the Windows version.
